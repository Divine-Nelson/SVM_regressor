# Evaluation of Machine Learning Regressors: Implementation and Analysis
This project applies multiple regression algorithms to the California Housing dataset to predict median house values. The work is part of a machine learning lab assignment and is inspired by Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron.

## Project Overview

• Goal: Evaluate and compare different machine learning regressors to identify which performs best on housing price prediction.

• Dataset: California Housing dataset (1990 census data).

• Target variable: Median house value.
