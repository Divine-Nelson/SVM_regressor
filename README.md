# Evaluation of Machine Learning Regressors: Implementation and Analysis
This project applies multiple regression algorithms to the California Housing dataset to predict median house values. The work is part of a machine learning lab assignment and is inspired by Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron.

## Project Overview

• Goal: Evaluate and compare different machine learning regressors to identify which performs best on housing price prediction.

• Dataset: California Housing dataset (1990 census data).

• Target variable: Median house value.

## Methods



A full preprocessing pipeline was built, including:

• Handling missing values with median imputation

• Feature engineering (e.g., rooms per household, bedrooms per room)

• Scaling numerical features and encoding categorical features

Support Vector Regressor (SVR, linear, RBF kernels, polynomial kernels) were trained and evaluated with other models like Linear Regression, Decision tree, Random forest tree
